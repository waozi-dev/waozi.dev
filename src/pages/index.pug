  h1 Welcome!
  p I am Martin Schiller, alias Waotzi - inspired by Lao Tzu, expressing my wondering self.

  p I started developing at young age of 13. I had a natural curiosity on how technology works, and I wanted to dig deeper to make my own figures animate on this digital landscape.
  p This curiosity evoked my digital journey, continuously exploring and developing new bytes.

  p I work as a freelancer and have acquired various skills in full stack development, system administration and automation.
  p If you need my services please contact
