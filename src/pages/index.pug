    a(href="https://geocats.netlify.app") Geocats
    |  is a 2D action-platformer I contributed to while working at a video game startup. Although the startup ended, it was the beginning of my freelancing career.

  p Beyond these projects, I continue to explore the digital realm, engaging in freelance work and open source contributions. My mission is to blend technology with creativity, bringing unique ideas to life.
