  h1 Hello, World!
  p Welcome! Here's a glimpse into my journey and the projects I've passionately worked on. Feel free to explore these links for a deeper dive.
  
  h2 Applications
  p 
    a(href="https://naox.io/evoti") Evotico
    |  evolved from 'Ukuvota', a community voting platform I developed when I started traveling. It's designed to streamline the voting process for organizations and communities.

  p 
    a(href="https://naox.io/inbe") Inner Breeze
    |  was inspired by my discovery of the Wim Hof Breathing Method, this app helps users practice and track their progress, promoting focus and mindfulness.

  h2 Games
  p 
    a(href="https://geocats.netlify.app") Geocats
    |  is a 2D action-platformer I contributed to while working at a video game startup. Although the startup ended, it was the beginning of my freelancing career.

  p Beyond these projects, I continue to explore the digital realm, engaging in freelance work and open source contributions. My mission is to blend technology with creativity, bringing unique ideas to life.
